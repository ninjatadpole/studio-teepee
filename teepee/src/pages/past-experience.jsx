              <b className="brand">studio teepee</b> is led by Matt Plummer,
              whose passion is to create homes which are comfortable,
              delightful, and enriching.  To be successful, such homes require
              an appreciation for community, privacy, spatial composition,
              materiality, texture, and
              sustainability, among many other considerations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Matt’s past projects have been diverse in scale and complexity,
              and have provided many opportunities to explore these design
              themes in detail, and to understand the challenges these themes
              face during the processes of planning, building control, and
              construction.
